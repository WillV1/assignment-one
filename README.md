# assignment-one

In this assignment, I took existing code for a webpage and:

1. Ensured that all links are functioning correctly 
2. Refactored the div tags in the HTML code, replacing them with semantic HTML tags, 
3. Used techniques such as alt properties within image tags to improve web assessibility
4. Cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and
5. Included comments before each element or section of the CSS page.
